# *“What is good code? Evaluating code quality”*

Inspired by the awesome [99 bottles of OOP ](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) book, participants are asked to pair during 30 minutes trying to satisfy one of the initial test suites contained in this repository.

Looking for the companion material to the workshop? It can be found @ [dcarral/good-code](https://github.com/dcarral/good-code).

## Solving the kata

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to the directory named after your language of choice.
3. Follow the instructions contained in its README.
4. Happy hacking! :)

**Important:** Please, don't hesitate to ping a facilitator if you run into any kind of problem following the previous steps.

**Tip:** Extract the initial test suite to an external directory to init a fresh Git repository able to keep track of your work.

## Contributing: improving test suites

During the early days of the workshop, participants were asked to code on top of the upstream repository from Sandi Metz.

Due to several pairs struggling with the provided project setups, the detection of inconsistencies among languages, and the inconvenience of the Exercism-dependant constraints, this fork was created trying to provide a smoother developer experience.

You can check out some of that work by taking a look at [recent pull requests](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/pulls). 

It's been awesome to receive pull requests from workshop participants and any contributions in this regard would be highly appreciated :)

## Original test suites

They can be found in the [upstream repository by Sandi Metz](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles-polyglot).
